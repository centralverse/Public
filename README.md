- Create a [leader election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election) system where a user can create a group and control synchronous playback (play/pause/reset) of the audio file for any other user that joins his/her group - other users should be able to join the group via entering group name (audio file will have to be downloaded locally first before being able to join synchronous playback)
